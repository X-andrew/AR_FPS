# What this project aims to do.
This Project was made within 24 hours, demonstrating how we have connected our controller(Made using Arduino) and Unity, transmitting Real Movements to Virtual ones. This makes the game more interactive and immersive.
This is a First Person Shooter game.
2 UltraSonic Sensors were used to keep track to physical movements in 2D Space, which helps user point the rifle.
A Trigger is made using IR Sensor, to fire the rifle and burst the balloons, which are moving in random direction.
